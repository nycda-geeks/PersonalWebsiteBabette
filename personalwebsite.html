      I am interested in everything that has to do with music and technoglogy. Thereby, I love listening to classical as well as electronic music.
      I found it fascinating to see how music shifts to a digital environment as technolgy develops. That is why I decided to specialize
      in the contemporary music and get involved with the global music industry.

      As I would like to combine both of my interests in a future profession, I aim to be a developer in the music industry.
      Preferably, I wish to be part of a music related start-up in order to take up the challenge of making it succeed in its field.
